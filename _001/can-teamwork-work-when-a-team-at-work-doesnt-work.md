It’s Wednesday. You’re halfway through your week, and if you could, you’d be crossing the minutes off a calendar. Suddenly, you see the Slack icon quietly bouncing up and down. Coworker A has submitted a pull request, and would be immensely grateful if you could review it before it goes off to destroy prod. It’s showtime! You dust off your programming armour, head off to the kitchen of the faraway land that is the other end of the office, and mentally prepare yourself for the task ahead.  

Except that as you sit back at your desk, you notice that Coworker B has left some comments. Suddenly, your fingers curl tighter around your cup. You feel your head retract into a shell you do not possess, and the rest of your body braces itself for the battle to come. It takes approximately 2.3 milliseconds for Coworker B to offend Coworker A. It does not matter who is right anymore, it is merely a rite of passage that no comment on a pull request shall be ignored.  

As you scramble to find virtually anything else to do until these two stop generating Slack notifications at the speed of light, you receive a private message. It’s Coworker B, confused as to how they offended Coworker A and asking for advice. Suddenly, Slack boops again. This time, it’s Coworker A, venting about how Coworker B is so unhelpful and unjustly critical. There is no escape.  

You must face the coworker hydra alone, and its heads are numerous. Quickly, you soften Coworker B’s tone in the comments they want to post. Next, you reassure Coworker A that their feelings are valid and try to convince them that Coworker B just communicates differently.  

It works for now. An eerie calm falls back onto your channel. Your beverage is cold. It’s still Wednesday…  

Sometimes, it doesn’t matter how hard you try, the glue that is supposed to bond your team together just dries and flakes and falls apart. It leaves gaping holes filled with misunderstandings, contempt and apathy. And even though it is obvious that your team is hurting, there is no cure for it other than a change you cannot bring about.

So when change cannot happen, what can you do? You can become glue. Being glue is a thankless, exhausting task. It is bridging the gaps in communication, maintaining peace, bringing everyone together. Sometimes it will be editing a teammate’s message to another teammate, ensuring it is not as abrasive as it might have been. Sometimes it will be trying to show another teammate that someone’s intentions were good, only misguided. Often, it will be to convince them to leave aside their individuality and try to act as a team and have each other’s back.  

The only reward will be to know that the alternative would only be worse. But regardless of how unpleasant the work may be, being glue is about finding, and remembering your common humanity. It is about finding patience, and kindness, and compassion to accept the fact that sometimes, the only thing you can do is wait for change to happen.
