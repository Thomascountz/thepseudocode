It may not come as a surprise to many in our industry, that worldwide Google searchs for the term “Remote Work” shows an upward trend over the past decade and a half. I’ve asked my friend [Christine](https://twitter.com/zagtag), who works remotely as a software engineer, open source maintainer, and community organizer, to tell me a little bit about her experience of being remote.

**What does a good day look like?**

> Finishing everything that I put in my standup, not getting pulled in too many directions, having a good chunk of time to concentrate on a challenging and consuming feature/bug, and pairing with a team member (particularly, talking through ways to improve the code that we're working on).

**What does a bad day look like?**

> Getting pulled in too many directions, back-and-forth in multiple Slack channels, Github notifications, error monitoring pings…all while trying (and failing) to make progress on my priorities for the day…by 5pm, I can’t remember what I was doing or why I just opened a new tab in Terminal, and I don’t feel like I’ve gotten much done.

**What weren't you prepared for when you first began working remotely that you feel well-equipped for now?**

> Probably the way that the day can blur together…to counteract that I’ve developed a routine that gives me milestones throughout the day, which are helpful as mini-deadlines (maybe I want to review 2 PRs in the hour before lunch) and as forced breaks. I start the day at a coffeeshop (got to get out of the house), mid-morning break walking back from the coffeeshop, lunch, usually schedule meetings in early afternoon, mid-afternoon tea and snacks, and lastly, since I work at my dinner table, I have an end-of-day routine of putting away my work stuff.
